                <p>Cartesi is an off-chain decentralized computation platform. Cartesi is unique in the sense that it allows decentralized applications to be run on Linux in a way that's verifiable by the blockchain. Complex processing can be executed off-chain free from blockchains'  computational limits and corresponding fees.

                  By offering a Linux runtime environment, Cartesi is the only software-based verifiable off-chain compute system that gives developers a vast array of software that evolved in the last 30 years and that enable the applications we use on the Internet today.

                  <p>Then, there's the second problem. Besides being hampered by insufficient software infrastructure, decentralized applications also suffer tight on-chain prGreaocessing limits. So, they can hardly offer a compelling alternative to mainstream centralized applications. They are often hard to build, being clunky and limited for developers and DApp users.
                  Cartesi solves these three problems by 1) offering developers the software and tools supported by a full Linux OS; 2) moving off-chain all the heavy computation over large amounts of data, that blockchains cannot do; 3) offering services and a token economy that allows users to securely rely on the network and remain free from inconveniences of blockchain tech (e.g. slow confirmation times, requirement to remain online to resolve disputes, and others).

                <p>Blockchains don't support mainstream computations that we take for granted on our computers and devices. Typically these computations comprise billions or trillions of steps and involve large amounts of data. The processing and data exceed by orders of magnitude the computational throughput capacity of a blockchain. We have also seen a lot of on-chain scaling solutions emerging, but none of them have achieved any significant and convincing results so far. </p>

                <p>With Cartesi, we can have typical real-world computations running off-chain on a Linux environment (as they often do!), in a way that's verifiable by the blockchain. DApp users can achieve consensus off-chain and if there's an attempt of fraudulent computation, Cartesi uses the blockchain as a supreme court, identifying and punishing dishonest parties. In the rare cases when these dispute resolutions arise, the blockchain runs an interactive dispute resolution and is left to run a single step of the original computation with a negligible amount of data (we use a Verification Game implementation, akin to Truebit). That happens at a negligible cost to the blockchain. Btw, compared with some well-known Layer-2 solutions, Cartesi doesn’t require parties to remain on-line all the time to participate. Therefore, Cartesi is a platform that users can enjoy the benefit of decentralization without sensing it. </p>

                <p>Finally, the Cartesi Network and the Cartesi Token employ economic incentives and services that allow users to participate in DApps in a secure and convenient way.

It's more than a simple technology, but a versatile platform that will benefit blockchain applications, regardless of the industry.

                <p>Cartesi is not a public chain. Its first implementation is on Ethereum. But it can work on top of any public blockchain supporting smart contracts. It is blockchain-agnostic. In fact, it’s also agnostic to the consensus mechanism, being able to rely on Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, some BFT variant or some kind of quorum. </p>
                
                <p>Our objective is to provide a much better computational layer for DApps. 
                In that sense, the computation is moved off-chain, outside of the consensus layer. The latter being only used to guarantee consensus and security. </p>

                <p>Cartesi is a platform for decentralized computation. In that sense, looking at Cartesi as a computer, the correct metric should be “Instructions per Second” (in the same way we would measure the power of CPU’s). The processing throughput (instructions per second) allowed by Cartesi is orders of magnitude of what can be emulated on-chain, allowing for an experience much closer to what we have on Web2.0 while preserving decentralization.</p>

                <p>(That being said, any improvement on TPS on the base layer helps Cartesi to perform even better). 
                Finally, as Cartesi can connect to different blockchains it will be a powerful tool for interoperability and securely transferring data and value across chains.</p>

                <p>For example, a way in which Cartesi can enhance the power of Ethereum is to give future contracts the ability to read any data on the current state of the blockchain. It is currently not possible for a smart contract to read the balance of another account, or to read the storage of another contract (unless explicitly exposed on interfaces created by their developers).</p>

                <p>All of this would be made possible with the help of Cartesi. In principle, such a technology would enable Ethereum users to make insurances for blocked funds, bet on the total value raised in an ICO/IEO, etc.</p>

                <p>Some examples of Layer-1 solutions existing are:<br>
                
                - DPoS: Allows a small range of super nodes to verify all transactions, and these nodes are selected through democratic voting.<br>
                <br>
                - Sharding: Sharing groups accounts as different “shards”, these independent shards will then be linked to the main chain for cross-shard settlement.<br>
                <br>
                - Varieties of BFT, PBFT: Results in faster consensus compared to PoW, but with limited participants.</p>
                
                <p>All of these innovations intent to boost transaction processing power of the blockchain, but inevitably, finalizations of these transactions will still require global consensus, and when the computational demands of smart contracts or the number of accounts interacting grow beyond a certain threshold, the cost to reach global consensus will grow in a super-linear way, even in sharding technology, making it severely restrictive or infeasible.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Cartesi only tries to reach local consensus for the computation itself. Only the users who are interested in a particular computation are responsible for performing the off-chain computation and for the on-chain settlement, thus solving these issues.</p>

                <p>Nonetheless, these new layer-1 solutions can be integrated with Cartesi in order to combine the advantages of both.</p>

                <p>Comparison with Layer-2 solutions and IntegrThankation:</p>

                <p>A variety of Layer-2 solutions have also been proposed in order to improve the performance of blockchains, such as Plasma and State Channels. These allow a large number of transactions to be performed off-chain and then the proof of the transaction is submitted on-chain for settlement. Generally, these solutions require the blockchain to be able to resolve any possible disputes when Plasma exits, or when the state channel closes. In the worst case, heavy computations will be replayed on-chain, from the moment of channel opening. Obviously, this mechanism limits the maximum transaction volume or computational complexity that can happen off-chain, since the mainchain is unable to settle them efficiently.</p>


                <p>Integrating Cartesi can greatly improve these types of technologies, as it allows both a Plasma or a State Channel to exploit full computational power from the Cartesi Machine, and in case any divergence arises, the mainchain is able to settle any disputes through Cartesi’s verification game, no matter how complicated the contract was.</p>

                <p>Cartesi is quite similar to TrueBit at first glance, but they differ vastly in their design decisions. The first major difference between TrueBit and Cartesi concerns the virtual machine itself; TrueBit’s virtual machine is based on WebAssembly (WASM). WASM is the W3C Community Group’s Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for efficient web applications, while Cartesi’s virtual machine implements the RISC-V ISA.</p>

                <p>TrueBit’s technology focuses on boosting the computational power for smart contracts, which operate under a bare-bones runtime environment. However, as we said earlier, the applications that we use on the Web or our devices don't exist in isolation. Instead, they stand on top of an operating system and depend on numerous software components that evolved throughout decades. Our architectural choice enables Cartesi computations to run on a proper operating system. In this environment, DApps are built with mainstream software stacks, which allows for vast new possibilities, besides being easier to code and with much lower entry barrier for professionals.</p>

                <p> Yes. One of the differences of greatest consequence is in how Cartesi aligns the interest in off-chain computations with the responsibility for their execution. In TrueBit, there is no such alignment. A smart contract posts the computation to a pool of untrusted parties and waits for one of them to perform it off-chain and post the result back. In this sense, TrueBit can be seen as a means for increasing the computational power of individual smart contracts. Cheating is prevented with a complex incentive layer that rewards pool members for successively disputing incorrect results. To keep the members engaged, computations with incorrect results must be artificially injected by the incentive layer. This inefficiency is a fundamental part of the design of TrueBit.
        </p><p>
Conversely, Cartesi can be seen as a way for off-chain computations to be endorsed by a smart contract. All parties that could be affected by this endorsement are responsible for performing the computation off-chain and, if needed, starting a dispute. Although the ensuing verification can be outsourced to a dispute resolution market, there is no built-in inefficiency and no need for an incentive layer.

                <p>CTSI has been designed to overcome the basic challenges that blockchains face in terms of usability and scalability. The Cartesi Network will rely on PoS protocols to provide services such as a side-chain optimized for high throughput and temporary data storage for DApps. CTSI is also used in the incentive protocol as specified in the Cartesi Core (whitepaper) and other convenient services that the Cartesi Network will offer (ex: commit-reveal protocols). Finally, CTSI will isolate DApp developers and users from the instabilities of the different underlying blockchains. In the long run, the CTSI is expected to capture most of the value in the DApp ecosystem, with DApps being portable across different blockchains. </p>

              <p>Cartesi implements a self-contained and deterministic VM that emulates a RISC-V architecture. That
              means that given a specification of the initial state of the VM (e.g. input data and program to run) and considering a given number of steps of processing, the VM state advances precisely in the same way, regardless of the system hosting the VM.</p>

              <p>RISC-V is an open instruction set architecture that was designed from the ground up to support a modern operating system. It is not much more complex than a smart-contract VM. It's just better suited for the purpose of running real-world programs on top of an OS. The Linux kernel and several Linux distributions (and other OSes!) have already been ported to it. There are mature compilers. It is a much better match for the problem that Cartesi is trying to solve: bringing real-world computations to the blockchain.</p>
