            A vigorous Cartesi community is vital to the team’s worldwide
            objectives in the DApp space. As we continue to progressively expand
            our community, we're on the look-out for leaders, novel ideas, and
            continuous improvements to our social infrastructure. To enhance
            brand awareness and sufficiently establish a broader influential
            sphere, we are devoted to on-boarding talent in a formalized method.
