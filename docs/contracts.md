title: Contracts
---

:::note Section Goal
- explain the design pattern used in all of them (Instantiator interface and instantiate instead of constructor)
- explain what is a contract instance, active/inactive, concerned
- explain getSubInstances and how this evolves into a tree of instances
- explain getCurrentState and getState and how it maps to a state machine style of DApp 
- this chapter will be very loose at this point, but it will be useful later on.
