I also thought of another (more cannonic) way of using trusted/remote Nodes. We can imagine Descartes DApps using Metamask as DApps normally do. In that case the user doesn't need to trust their assets to the custodial service (although i think this option should remain there). 
Instead, remote Node wallets are managed only by us (service provider), only to pay ETH fees for Descartes itself and for placing collaterals. 
In this case the user or DApp developer only pays for the service itself (probably we charge in CTSI only as you suggested). It's on us to fund each node with ETH and to place collaterals. 

Then, the custodial option should be kept. As it can be highly convenient, depending on the application and it should be well explained and promoted. But perhaps the above should be our default mode when explaining Cartesi's topology and the PaaS, as this will probably raise less concerns about "centralization". Besides, this is the way people are already to think when they develop on Ethereum.
