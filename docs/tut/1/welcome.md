## Welcome to The Cartesi Tutorials!

*The Cartesi Tutorials* (this section of the documentation) is a knowledge base that exists to help you learn everything about the Cartesi SDK from the ground up, through easy step-by-step instructions.

All of the tutorials and their suggested steps have been applied, in the order suggested by the navigation bar on the left, to a fresh [Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) installation.

If you follow the tutorials in the suggested order and correctly reproduce all of the steps in your local development environment, all of them should work, unchanged.

However, if you're not running an Ubuntu LTS, or if you're not starting a development environment from scratch, you may need to do a bit of adaptation or maintenance to get the Cartesi development environment working with what you have in your development machine. Sometimes, the tutorials will include notes or links related to adapting steps to other Operating Systems or to resolving common conflicts.
