## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how Descartes can be used to implement a solution for a more realistic use case: verifying document signatures using GPG. 

Oftentimes, a smart contract needs to validate that a given set of data is indeed authentic, in the sense that it can be trusted to have been provided by a specified agent, and that it has not been tampered. *Digital signatures* are a great way of achieving that goal. The general idea is that a given user or organization employs a *private key* to generate a signature for a specific document. Any party that receives a copy of that document and the associated signature can then use the organization's corresponding *public key*, which is openly distributed, to check the integrity and authenticity of the data.

The [GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG)](https://www.gnupg.org/) is a widely used tool for encrypting and signing data, and is commonly available in Linux distributions. As such, in this project we will use it inside a Cartesi Machine to check whether a given document's signature is indeed valid. We will detail how to build this solution in the following sections, and a complete implementation can be directly accessed within the [Descartes Tutorials GitHub repo](https://github.com/cartesi/descartes-tutorials/tree/master/gpg-verify).


## Initializing the DApp project

To begin with, let's create a directory for our project and initialize it using Truffle, as [discussed before](../../helloworld/create-project/): 

```bash
mkdir gpg-verify
cd gpg-verify
truffle init
```

As always, we need to edit the generated `truffle-config.js` file in order to match the port and network ID of the `Ganache CLI` instance running inside our [development environment](../../descartes-env):

```javascript
networks: {
  development: {
   host: "127.0.0.1",     // Localhost (default: none)
   port: 8545,            // Ganache CLI port (default: none)
   network_id: "7777",    // Environment network (default: none)
  },
},
```

Finally, add these required project dependencies to Truffle and the Descartes SDK:

```bash
yarn add @cartesi/descartes-sdk@0.2.0
yarn add @truffle/contract --dev
```

## Public key file

As explained above, the idea of signing documents is that any party can use an openly distributed *public key* to check the validity of a signature. As such, to implement this project we will need to acquire such a key and make it available to our DApp.

In fact, a specific *keypair* for a fictional user `descartes.tutorials@cartesi.io` was created just for the purposes of this tutorial, and both its public and private keys are available in the [Descartes Tutorials GitHub repo](https://github.com/cartesi/descartes-tutorials/tree/master/gpg-verify/cartesi-machine).

To download the public key to an appropriate location, first create a `cartesi-machine` directory and `cd` into it:

```bash
mkdir cartesi-machine
cd cartesi-machine
```

Then, download the public key by typing:
```bash
wget https://github.com/cartesi/descartes-tutorials/blob/master/gpg-verify/cartesi-machine/descartes-pub.key
```

With that set, in the next section we will learn how to supply this key to a Cartesi Machine using an `ext2` file-system, so that we can experiment with GPG signature verification inside a Cartesi Machine.
