:::note Section Goal
- give step by step instructions about how to build a DApp using the Descartes SDK
:::


*The Descartes Tutorials* are a knowledge base that exists to help you learn everything about the Descartes SDK from the ground up, through easy step-by-step instructions. The tutorials focus on using the SDK to build DApps that perform secure and validated off-chain computations using two local Descartes nodes. The nodes represent users `alice` and `bob`, who respectively play the roles of claimer and challenger.

All of the tutorials and their suggested steps have been applied, in the order suggested by the navigation bar on the left, to a fresh [Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) installation. As such, if you follow the tutorials in the suggested order and correctly reproduce all of the steps in your local development environment, then every step should work, unchanged. However, if you're not running an Ubuntu LTS, or if you're not starting a development environment from scratch, you may need to do a bit of adaptation or maintenance to get the Descartes development environment working with what you have in your development machine.

In the following sections, we will first go through [general requirements](../requirements/) needed to run the tutorials. Then, we will get a full [Descartes SDK Environment](../descartes-env/) up and running, before we dive into our first [Hello World DApp tutorial](../helloworld/create-project/)
