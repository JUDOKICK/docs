- give step by step instructions about how to build a DApp using the Descartes SDK

## Welcome to The Descartes Tutorials!

*The Descartes Tutorials* (this section of the documentation) is a knowledge base that exists to help you learn everything about the Descartes SDK from the ground up, through easy step-by-step instructions. The tutorials will focus on using the Descartes SDK to build DApps that perform secure and validated off-chain computations using two local Descartes nodes. The two nodes will represent users `alice` and `bob`, who will respectively play the roles of claimer and challenger.

All of the tutorials and their suggested steps have been applied, in the order suggested by the navigation bar on the left, to a fresh [Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) installation.

If you follow the tutorials in the suggested order and correctly reproduce all of the steps in your local development environment, all of them should work, unchanged.

However, if you're not running an Ubuntu LTS, or if you're not starting a development environment from scratch, you may need to do a bit of adaptation or maintenance to get the Cartesi development environment working with what you have in your development machine. Sometimes, the tutorials will include notes or links related to adapting steps to other Operating Systems or to resolving common conflicts.
